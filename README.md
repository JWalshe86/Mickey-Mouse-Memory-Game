<!-- Original inspiration from my 3 year old daughter loving Micky Mouse. A google search of first JavaScript projects
repeatedly showed 'memory game'. I was able to envision my daughter enjoying playing a memory game with Micky Mouse characters  -->

# Micky-Mouse-Memory-Game

Memory game is a simple grid based game where the player has to flip over two
cards. If both cards match, then the player receives a score of one. These cards
are then removed from the game, leaving the player with the remainder of the cards
to flip over. The game is over when all the cards have been matched and there's no 
remaining cards to flip over.
